# GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

I learned about issues, pull requests, and the structure of a GitHub repository:

  * I learned about branching;
  * I created a commit;
  * I viewed and responded to pull request reviews;
  * I edited an existing file;
  * I enabled GitHub Pages;
  * I made your first contribution!
